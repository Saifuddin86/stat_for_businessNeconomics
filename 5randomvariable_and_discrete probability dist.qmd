# Random variable and Discrete Probability Distribution

## Definition

A **variable** is said to be **random** if its values are determined by a random experiment. In other word, **random variable** is a numerical description of the outcome of an experiment.

-   A random variable often denoted with an uppercase letter (say $X$)

-   The value of a random variable is denoted with a lowercase letter (say $x$)

**Illustration** Consider a random experiment of tossing a coin (fair/unfair) 2 times. Then the sample space is

$$
S=\{ HH,HT,TH,TT \}
$$

Now let, $X= number\ \  of\ \  heads \ \ occur$

From the sample space we can see that $X$ can take following values:

|                  |     |
|:----------------:|:---:|
| **Sample point** | $x$ |
|       $HH$       |  2  |
|       $HT$       |  1  |
|       $TH$       |  1  |
|       $TT$       |  0  |

Since the values of $X$ completely determined by the outcomes of the random experiment, so $X$ is a random variable (discrete).

## Types of random variable

There are two types of random variables, **discrete** and **continuous**.\
A **discrete random variable** can assume only a certain number of separated values. A discrete random variable is usually the result of *counting* something. [For example,]{.underline} number of customers arrive, number of calls receive etc.

A **continuous random variable** is one whose values are uncountable or which can take any value in a given interval. Generally a continuous random variable is usually the result of *measuring* something.

## Discrete random variable and Probability mass function

Suppose $X$ is a discrete random variable. The **probability mass function (PMF)** of $X$ can be denoted as $f(x)$ where

$$ f(x)=P(X=x) $$For each possible outcome $x$ ; $f(x)$ must satisfies:

1.  $$f(x) \ge 0$$

2.  $$\sum _x f(x)=1$$

The **PMF** $f(x)$ is also called probability distribution of the discrte random variable $X$.

**Example 5.1** John Ragsdale sells new cars for Pelican Ford. John usually sells the largest number of cars on Saturday. He has developed the following probability distribution for the number of cars he expects to sell on a particular Saturday.

|                              |                         |
|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| **Number of cars sold,** $x$ | **Probability,** $f(x)$ |
|              0               |          0.10           |
|              1               |          0.20           |
|              2               |          0.30           |
|              3               |          0.30           |
|              4               |          0.10           |

**Compute** (i) $P(X=2)$ ; (ii) $P(X<2)$ ; (iii) $P(X \ge 3)$\

### Expectation (Mean) of discrete random variable

Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with probability mass function $f(x) = P(X = x)$.

The mean of $X$ is given by

$$\mu=\sum_x x.f(x)$$\
The mean of $X$ is sometimes called the expectation, or expected value, of X and may also be denoted by $E(X)$ or by $\mu$.\

**Example 5.2** John Ragsdale sells new cars for Pelican Ford. John usually sells the largest number of cars on Saturday. He has developed the following probability distribution for the number of cars he expects to sell on a particular Saturday.

|                              |                         |
|:----------------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| **Number of cars sold,** $x$ | **Probability,** $f(x)$ |
|              0               |          0.10           |
|              1               |          0.20           |
|              2               |          0.30           |
|              3               |          0.30           |
|              4               |          0.10           |

On a typical Saturday, how many cars does John expect to sell?\

[Solution:]{.underline}

|    $x$    |    $f(x)$     |        $x \cdot f(x)$        |
|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------------------------:|
|     0     |     0.10      |             0.00             |
|     1     |     0.20      |             0.20             |
|     2     |     0.30      |             0.60             |
|     3     |     0.30      |             0.90             |
|     4     |     0.10      |             0.40             |
| **Total** | $\sum f(x)=1$ | $\mu =\sum x\cdot f(x)=2.10$ |

: Calculation of the Expected Value for the Number of Cars Sold

**Alternative:** The mean number of cars is:

$$\mu =E[X]=\sum_{x=0}^4 x.f(x)$$

$$=0(0.10)+1(0.20)+2(0.30)+3(0.30)+4(0.10)=2.1$$

So on a typical Saturday, John Ragsdale expects to sell a mean of 2.1 cars a day.

### Variance of discrete random variable

Let $X$ be a discrete random variable with probability distribution $f(x)$ and mean $\mu$. The variance of $X$ is

$$var(X)=\sigma^2 =E[(X-\mu)^2]=\sum_x (x-\mu)^2 f(x)$$**Alternative:**

$$var (X)=E(X^2)-\mu^2$$ Where,

$$E(X^2)=\sum_{x} x^2.f(x)$$

**Example 5.3:** From Example 5.2 **compute** *variance* and *standard deviation* of $X$.

[Solution:]{.underline} From Example 5.2 we have $\mu =2.1$.

|    $x$    |    $f(x)$     | $x-\mu$ | $(x-\mu)^2$ | $(x-\mu)^2 f(x)$  |
|:---------:|:-------------:|:-------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
|     0     |     0.10      |  -2.1   |    4.41     |       0.441       |
|     1     |     0.20      |  -1.1   |    1.21     |       0.242       |
|     2     |     0.30      |  -0.1   |    0.01     |       0.003       |
|     3     |     0.30      |   0.9   |    0.81     |       0.243       |
|     4     |     0.10      |   1.9   |    3.61     |       0.361       |
| **Total** | $\sum f(x)=1$ |         |             | $\sigma^2 =1.290$ |

: Calculation of the Variance for the Number of Cars Sold

\
**Alternative:** Here,

$$E(X^2)=\sum_{x=0}^4 x^2.f(x)$$

$=0^2(0.10)+1^2 (0.20)+2^2 (0.30)+3^2 (0.30)+4^2 (0.10)$

$=5.70$

Hence, $var(X)=\sigma^2 =E(X^2)-\mu^2=5.70-(2.10)^2=1.29$

-   The variance is, $\sigma^2=1.29$ and

-   The standard deviation is, $\sigma=\sqrt {1.29}=1.136$

|:-------------------:|:-------------:|

## Some Discrete Probability Distributions

In the following sections we will discuss some commonly used discrete probability distributions which are used to predict number of success in finite number of random trials, or number of occurrence in a given interval or space and so on.

### Bernoulli distribution/r.v

Bernoulli r.v comes from **Bernoulli trial-**a trial which has **TWO** possible outcomes (*success* or *failure*).

Consider the toss of a **biased coin**, which comes up a head with probability $p$, and a tail with probability $1 - p$. The **Bernoulli random variable** takes the two values 1 and 0, depending on whether the outcome is a head or a tail:

$$
X=1 ; if \ \  a \ \ head,\\
X=0 ;  if\ \  a \ \ tail.
$$\
**PMF:** $P(X=x)=f(x)=p^x (1-p)^{1-x}; \ \ x=0,1$

**Mean:** $E(X)=p$

**Variance:** $Var(X)=p(1-p)$

For all its simplicity, the Bernoulli random variable is very important. In practice, it is used to model generic probabilistic situations with just two outcomes, such as:

\(a\) The state of a telephone at a given time that can be either free or busy.

\(b\) A person who can be either healthy or sick with a certain disease.

\(c\) The preference of a person who can be either for or against a certain political candidate.\

Furthermore, by combining multiple Bernoulli random variables, one can construct more complicated random variables.

::: callout-note
**Derivation of Mean and Variance of Bernoulli r.v**

**Mean:**

$$E(X)=\sum_{x=0}^1 x\cdot f(x)=(0) f(0)+(1)f(1)=0+1\cdotp p=p$$

**Variance:**

$Var(X)=E(X^2)-[E(X)]^2=p-p^2=p(1-p)$
:::

### Binomial r.v

In a Binomial experiment , the **Bernoulli trial** is repeated $n$ times with the following conditions:

a\) The trials are independent

b\) In each trial $P(success)=p$ remains constant

Suppose $X=number \ \ of \ \ successs \ \ in \ \ n\ \ trials$. Then $X$ is called a **Binomial r.v** or follows **Binomial distribution.**

**PMF:** $$P(X=x)=f(x)=\binom {n}{x} p^x (1-p)^{n-x} ; x=0,1,2,...,n$$

**Mean:** $E(X)=np$

**Variance:** $Var(X)=np(1-p)$

[**We write**]{.underline} $X\sim Bin (n,p)$

::: callout-note
## Note

If $Y=number \ \ of \ \ failures\ \ in \ \ n\ \ trials$ then

$Y\sim Bin(n,1-p)$
:::

::: callout-note
## Relation between Bernoulli r.v and Binomial r.v

A **Binomial Random Variable** Is a **Sum of Bernoulli Random Variables**

Let, $Y_i$ is a Bernoulli r.v appeared in $i^{th}$ Bernoulli trial. If we conduct $n$ independent Bernoulli trials then we have $n$ independent Bernoulli r.vs such as $Y_1, Y_2, ..., Y_n$. Each $Y_i$ has values of either $1$ or $0$.

Now if $X$ is a Binomial r.v then,

$$
X=Y_1+Y_2+...+Y_n =\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i
$$
:::

::: callout-note
**Derivation of Mean and Variance of Binomial r.v**

From previous note, we know if $Y_i$ is a Bernoulli r.v then

$E(Y_i)=p$ and $Var(Y_i)=p(1-p)$

*So, the mean of Binomial r.v that is*

$$
E(X)=E(Y_1+Y_2+...+Y_n)
$$

$$
=E(Y_1)+E(Y_2)+...+E(Y_n)
$$

$$
=p+p+...+p=np
$$

*Now, the variance of* $X$ *is:*

$$
Var(X)=Var(Y_1+Y_2+...+Y_n)
$$

$$
=Var(Y_1)+Var(Y_2)+...+Var(Y_n)
$$

$$
=p(1-p)+p(1-p)+...+p(1-p)=np(1-p)
$$

### Poisson r.v

In this section we consider a discrete random variable that is often useful in estimating the number of occurrences over a specified interval of time or space. *For example*, the random variable of interest might be

-   the *number of arrivals* at a car wash in [one hour]{.underline},

-   the *number of repairs* needed in [10 miles]{.underline} of highway, or

-   the *number of leaks* in [100 miles]{.underline} of pipeline.

**PROPERTIES OF A POISSON EXPERIMENT**

1.  The probability of an occurrence is the same for any two intervals of equal length.

2.  The occurrence or nonoccurrence in any interval is independent of the occurrence or nonoccurrence in any other interval.

Suppose $X$ be the number occurrences in a given **interval.** Then,

**PMF:**

$$
P(X=x)=f(x)=\frac{\mu^x e^{-\mu}}{x!}\ \ ; \ \ x=0,1,2,...,\infty
$$

Where, $\mu$ is the expected value or mean number of occurrences in an interval.

**Mean:** $E(X)=\mu$

**Variance:** $Var(X)=\mu$\
[**We write,**]{.underline} $X \sim Pois(\mu)$

**Finding probability of Poisson r.v**

Let, $X$ be a Poisson r.v with $\mu=2.5$. Find the following probabilities.

a\) $P(X=2)$

b\) $P(X<=1)$

c\) $P(X>3)$

**Example** **911 Calls.** Emergency 911 calls to a small municipality in Idaho come in at the rate of one every 2 minutes. [@anderson2020, page no. 261]

a\. What is the expected number of 911 calls in one hour?

b\. What is the probability of three 911 calls in five minutes?

c\. What is the probability of no 911 calls in a five-minute period?\

**Example** **Airport Passenger-Screening Facility**. Airline passengers arrive randomly and independently at the passenger-screening facility at a major international airport. The mean arrival rate is 10 passengers per minute. [@anderson2020, page no. 261]

a\. Compute the probability of no arrivals in a one-minute period.

b\. Compute the probability that three or fewer passengers arrive in a one-minute period.

c\. Compute the probability of no arrivals in a 15-second period.

d\. Compute the probability of at least one arrival in a 15-second period.

**Poisson Approximation to the Binomial Distribution**

When,

-   $p \rightarrow0$ (*Success rate is very low*);

-   $n\rightarrow \infty$ (*Number of trials is very large*);

Then **Binomial distribution** can be *approximated* by **Poisson distribution**.

-   Mathematically, $Bin (x; n,p)\approx Pois(x;\mu)$; where $\mu=np$.

::: callout-note
**In practical situation** if $n > 20$ and $np\le 7$ ; then the approximation is close enough to use the Poisson distribution for binomial problems[@black2012].
:::

**Example** A college has 250 personal computers. The probability that any 1 of them will require repair in a given week is 0.01. Find the probability that fewer than 3 of the personal computers will require repair in a particular week. Use the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution.\

**Example** It is estimated that 0.5 percent of the callers to the Customer Service department of Dell Inc. will receive a busy signal. What is the probability that of today’s 1,200 callers at least 3 received a busy signal?

**Example** Ms. Bergen is a loan officer at Coast Bank and Trust. From her years of experience, she estimates that the probability is .025 that an applicant will not be able to repay his or her installment loan. Last month she made 40 loans. a. What is the probability that 3 loans will be defaulted?

b\. What is the probability that at least 3 loans will be defaulted?\
