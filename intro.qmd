# Data and Statistics

## Statistics

**Statistics** is defined as the art and science of collecting, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data.

*Particularly* in business and economics, the information provided by collecting, analyzing, presenting, and interpreting data gives managers and decision makers a better understanding of the business and economic environment and thus enables them to make more informed and better decisions.

## Applications in Business and Economics

-   **Accounting** Public accounting firms use *statistical sampling* procedures when conducting audits for their clients.

-   **Finance** Financial analysts use a variety of statistical information to guide their investment recommendations.

-   **Marketing** Electronic scanners at retail checkout counters collect data for a variety of marketing research applications.

-   **Production** Today’s emphasis on quality makes quality control an important application of statistics in production.

-   **Economics** Economists frequently provide forecasts about the future of the economy or some aspect of it. They use a variety of statistical information in making such forecasts.

## Data

**Data** are the facts and figures collected, analyzed, and summarized for presentation and interpretation. All the data collected in a particular study are referred to as the data set for the study.

@tbl-tab1.1 shows a data set containing information for 25 mutual funds that are part of the *Morningstar Funds500* for 2008.

: Data Set For 25 Mutual Funds {#tbl-tab1.1}

## Elements, Variables, and Observations

**Elements** are the entities on which data are collected. For the data set in Table 1.1 each individual mutual fund is an element: the element names appear in the first column. With 25 mutual funds, the data set contains 25 elements.

A **variable** is a characteristic of interest for the elements.

The data set in Table 1.1 includes the following five variables:

-   *Fund Type*: The type of mutual fund

-   *Net Asset Value (\$)*: The closing price per share on December 31, 2007

-   *5-Year Average Return (%)*: The average annual return for the fund over the past 5 years

-   *Expense Ratio*: The percentage of assets deducted each fiscal year for fund expenses

-   *Morningstar Rank*: The overall risk-adjusted star rating for each fund; Morningstar ranks go from a low of 1-Star to a high of 5-Stars

**Observation** *Measurements* collected on each variable for every element in a study provide the data. The set of measurements obtained for a particular element is called an *observation*.

-   Referring to Table 1.1 we see that the set of measurements for the first observation (American Century Intl. Disc) is IE, 14.37, 30.53, 1.41, and 3-Star.

## Scales of Measurement

Data collection requires one of the following scales of measurement: *nominal*, *ordinal*, *interval*, or *ratio* .

-   When the data for a variable consist of labels or names used to identify an attribute of the element, the scale of measurement is considered a *nominal* scale ( **Example: Fund Type**).

-   The scale of measurement for a variable is called an *ordinal* scale if the data exhibit the properties of nominal data and the order or rank of the data is meaningful ( **Example: Morningstar Rank**).

-   The scale of measurement for a variable is an *interval* scale if the data have all the properties of ordinal data and the interval between values is expressed in terms of a fixed unit of measure. Interval data are always numeric ( **Example: Temperature** ).

-   The scale of measurement for a variable is a *ratio* scale if the data have all the properties of interval data and the ratio of two values is meaningful ( **Example: distance, height, weight,time etc.**).

*This scale requires that a zero value be included to indicate that nothing exists for the variable at the zero point.*

## Quantitative and Categorical and Data

Data can be classified as either *quantitative or categorical* .

**Quantitative Data (Numerical Data)**

-   Data that represents numerical values.

-   Example: Heights of people, temperatures, test scores.

-   Subtypes:

    -   **Discrete Data**: Countable values (e.g., number of students in a class).

    -   **Continuous Data**: Measurable values that can take any value within a range (e.g., weight, time).

**Qualitative Data (Categorical Data)**

-   Data that represents categories or labels.

-   Example: Colors of cars, types of animals, survey responses (e.g., yes/no).

-   Subtypes:

    -   **Nominal Data**: Categories without a natural order (e.g., gender, blood type).

    -   **Ordinal Data**: Categories with a meaningful order (e.g., rankings, education levels).

The statistical analysis appropriate for a particular variable depends upon whether the variable is categorical or quantitative.

## Cross-Sectional and Time Series Data

For purposes of statistical analysis, distinguishing between cross-sectional data and time series data is important.

**Cross-sectional data** are data collected at the same or approximately the same point in time. The data in @tbl-tab1.1 are cross-sectional because they describe the five variables for the 25 mutual funds at the same point in time.

**Time series data** are data collected over several time periods. For example, the time series in Figure 1.1 shows the U.S. average price per gallon of conventional regular gasoline between 2006 and 2009.

![U.S. Average price per gallon for conventional regular gasoline](FIGURE%201.1.png){#fig-fig1.1}

## Descriptive Statistics

Most of the statistical information in newspapers, magazines, company reports, and other publications consists of data that are summarized and presented in a form that is easy for the reader to understand. Such summaries of data, which may be tabular, graphical, or numerical, are referred to as **descriptive statistics**.

## Inferential statistics (Statistical Inference)

Many situations require information about a large group of elements (individuals, companies, voters, households, products, customers, and so on). But, because of time, cost, and other considerations, data can be collected from only a small portion of the group. The larger group of elements in a particular study is called the **population**, and the smaller group is called the **sample**. Formally, we use the following definitions.

-   **Population** A population is the set of all elements of interest in a particular study.

-   **Sample** A sample is a subset of the population.

The process of conducting a survey to collect data for the entire population is called a **census**.

The process of conducting a survey to collect data for a sample is called a **sample survey**.

As one of its major contributions, statistics uses data from a sample to make estimates and test hypotheses about the characteristics of a population through a process referred to as **statistical inference**.
