# Descriptive statistic: Tabular and Graphical Presentations

## Summarizing Categorical Data

**Frequency Distribution**

A frequency distribution is a tabular summary of data showing the number (frequency) of items in each of several non overlapping classes.

**Example 2.1** Consider the following data shown in @tbl-tbl1.

|              |              |              |
|:-------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Coke Classic | Coke Classic | Coke Classic |
| Diet Coke    | Diet Coke    | Coke Classic |
| Pepsi        | Coke Classic | Pepsi        |
| Diet Coke    | Diet Coke    | Dr. Pepper   |
| Coke Classic | Coke Classic | Coke Classic |
| Coke Classic | Sprite       | Diet Coke    |
| Dr. Pepper   | Pepsi        | Pepsi        |
| Diet Coke    | Coke Classic | Pepsi        |
| Pepsi        | Coke Classic | Pepsi        |
| Pepsi        | Coke Classic | Pepsi        |
| Coke Classic | Pepsi        | Coke Classic |
| Dr. Pepper   | Coke Classic | Dr. Pepper   |
| Sprite       | Sprite       | Pepsi        |
| Coke Classic | Dr. Pepper   | Sprite       |
| Diet Coke    | Pepsi        | Coke Classic |
| Coke Classic | Diet Coke    | Sprite       |
| Coke Classic | Pepsi        |              |

: Data from a sample of 50 soft drink purchases {#tbl-tbl1}

Now we will construct a frequency distribution by simply counting each type of soft-drink.

```{r }
#| label: tbl-tbl2
#| tbl-cap: "Frequency distribution of Soft Drink Purchases"

library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
MBA <- read_excel("StatForBandE_data.xlsx",sheet = "Sheet1",range = "A1:A51")

MBA %>% count(`Soft Drink`) %>% kable(col.names = c("Soft Drink","Frequency"),align = c("l","c"))
```

**Relative Frequency and Percent Frequency Distributions**

-   Relative Frequency $=\frac{Frequency \ \ of \ \ the \ \ class}{n}$

-   The *percent frequency* of a class is the relative frequency multiplied by 100.

## Bar Charts and Pie Charts

-   **Bar chart:** A graphical device for depicting qualitative data that have been summarized in a frequency, relative frequency, or percent frequency distribution.

-   **Pie chart:** A graphical device for presenting data summaries based on subdivision of a circle into sectors that correspond to the relative frequency for each class.

From the frequency table of soft drinks purchase, we will develop relative and percent frequency distribution (see @tbl-tbl3) and will construct a **bar-chart** and **pie-chart**.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-tbl3
#| tbl-cap: "Frequency, Relative And Percent Frequency Distributions Of Soft Drink Purchases"
#| 

MBA %>% count(`Soft Drink`) %>% mutate(RF=n/sum(n),PF=RF*100) %>%
  kable(digits = 2,col.names = c("Soft Drink","Frequency (f)","Relative Frequency(Rf)", "Percent Frequency (Pf)"),
        align = c("l","c","c","c"))
  
```

Now we construct a bar chart and pie chart.

```{r}
#| label: fig-fig1
#| fig-cap: "Bar chart of Soft drink purchases"
#| fig-align: left
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618


library(patchwork)

bar<-MBA %>% ggplot(aes(x=`Soft Drink`,fill=`Soft Drink`))+
  geom_bar(color="black",lwd=.7)+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,30,2))+
  guides(fill=FALSE)+
  theme_classic()+
  #labs(title = "BAR CHART OF SOFT DRINK PURCHASES",y="Frequency")+
  theme(axis.text=  element_text(color = "black"))
  
bar

```

```{r}
#| label: fig-fig2
#| fig-cap: "Pie chart of Soft drink purchases"
#| fig-align: left
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618

pi_data<-MBA %>% count(`Soft Drink`) %>% mutate(RF=n/sum(n),labels = scales::percent(RF))


pi_chart<-ggplot(pi_data, aes(x = "", y = RF, fill = `Soft Drink`)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_label(aes(label = labels),color = c("white","white","white","white","black"),
            position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5),
            show.legend = FALSE,color="white") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Soft Drink")) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d() +
  coord_polar(theta = "y") + 
  #labs(title = "PIE CHART OF SOFT DRINK PURCHASES")+ 
  theme_void()

pi_chart
```

## Summarizing Quantitative Data

**Frequency Distribution** of quantitative data: Consider the following data.

YEAR-END AUDIT TIMES (IN DAYS): 12, 14, 19, 18, 15, 15, 18, 17, 20, 27, 22, 23, 22, 21, 33, 28, 14, 18, 16, 13,

```{r}
Audit<-c(12, 14, 19, 18, 15, 15, 18, 17,
20, 27, 22, 23, 22, 21, 33, 28,14, 18, 16, 13)
#summary(Audit)
```

To construct a frequency distribution we have to

1.  Determine the *number of non overlapping classes(k)*.
2.  Determine the *width* of each class.
3.  Determine the *class limits*.

## Frequency Distribution of quantitative data

Here, $n=20$, Smallest value=12, Largest value=33.

1.  Determine number of classes, $k$ as : $k=\sqrt n=\sqrt 20=4.47\approx5$. So $5$ is the number of *classes*.
2.  Class width $w$ as: $w=\frac{Largest-Smallest}{k}=\frac{33-12}{5}=4.2\approx 5$
3.  Class limits: Start from near *smallest* value (12) say from $10$ we have the following classes ([*exclusive method-where upper bound of the class is excluded*]{.underline}):

**\[10,15), \[15,20), \[20,25), \[25,30), and \[30,35)**

Now count the data values in corresponding classes and thus we have the *frequency distribution*. Once we have the frequency distribution then we also can produce the *relative* and *percent frequency distribution* (@tbl-tbl4 ).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-tbl4
#| tbl-cap: "Frequency, relative frequency (rf) and percent frequency (pf) distribution for the audit time data (n=20)" 

data.frame(Audit)->fd_data

fd_data %>% mutate(Audit_clas=ifelse(Audit%in%c(10:14),"[10,15)",
                              ifelse(Audit%in%c(15:19),"[15,20)",
                              ifelse(Audit%in%c(20:24),"[20,25)",                                         ifelse(Audit%in%c(25:29),"[25,30)","[30,35)")))))->fd

fd %>% count(Audit_clas) %>% mutate(rf=n/sum(n),pf=100*rf)->fd 

fd %>% kable(digits = 2,col.names = c("Audit Time (days)","Frequency (f) ","Rf", "Pf"),align = "c")

```

## Histogram

A common graphical presentation of quantitative data is a *histogram.* This graphical summary can be prepared for data previously summarized in either a *frequency*, *relative frequency*, or *percent frequency* distribution.

```{r fig.asp = 0.5, fig.width = 4}
#| label: fig-fig3
#| fig-cap: " HISTOGRAM FOR THE AUDIT TIME DATA"
#| fig-align: left
#| fig-height: 5
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-asp: 0.618

#png(filename="HISTOGRAM.png", width=600, height=600)

fd %>% ggplot(aes(x=Audit_clas,y=n))+geom_col(width =1,col="black",fill="steelblue")+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 0:8)+
  theme_classic()+
  labs(x="Audit Time (days)",y="Frequency")

#dev.off()


```

## HISTOGRAM and shape of the distribution

## Cumulative Distributions

A variation of the frequency distribution that provides another tabular summary of quantitative data is the *cumulative frequency* distribution.

## The Stem-and-Leaf Display

The techniques of **exploratory data analysis** consist of simple arithmetic and easy-to-draw graphs that can be used to summarize data quickly. One technique—referred to as a **stem-and-leaf display**—can be used to show both the rank order and shape of a data set simultaneously [@anderson2011].

**Steps to Construct a Stem-and-Leaf Diagram**

\(1\) Divide each number into two parts: a **stem**, consisting of one or more of the leading digits, and a **leaf**, consisting of the remaining digit.

\(2\) List the stem values in a vertical column.

\(3\) Record the leaf for each observation beside its stem.

\(4\) Write the units for stems and leaves on the display.\

**Example 2.2** Here are the number of questions answered correctly on an aptitude test given to 50 individuals recently interviewed for a position at Haskens Manufacturing.

#summary(stemleaf)

stem(stemleaf)
```
:::

**Exception**

In some data sets, providing more classes or stems may be desirable. One way to do this would be to modify the original stems as follows: For example, divide stem 5 into two new stems, 5L and 5U. Stem 5L has leaves 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and stem 5U has leaves 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. This will double the number of original stems. However, there may be various type of data in practical situations. So, we have to figure out the suitable stem-and-leaf plot.

**Example 2.3:** Construct a stem-and-leaf plot from the following data:

88.5, 98.8, 89.6, 92.2, 92.7, 88.4, 87.5, 90.9, 94.7, 88.3, 90.4, 83.4, 87.9, 92.6, 87.8, 89.9, 84.3, 90.4, 91.6, 91.0

stem(sl)
```

## Solution-II

```{r}
stem(sl,scale = 2)

**Example 2.4 (Another example):** Construct a stem-and-leaf plot from the following data: 7,8,2,1,8,3,5,7,1,2,2,5,8,5,5,7,8,7,5,3
