# Continuous r.v and Probability density function

## **Definition**

A continuous r.v $X$ must have a probability density function (PDF) $f(x)$ such that

$1) f(x) \ge 0$ **\[Non-negativity\]**

$2) \int_{x\in \mathbb{R}} f(x)dx =1$ **\[Total AREA under the curve** $f(x)$ always 1\]

## Illustration with an example

Given $f(x)=\frac{1}{2}x \ \ ; 0\le x\le 2$

a\) Show/plot the graph of $f(x)$.

b\) Is $f(x)$ a PDF?

c\) Find $P(X<1.0)$.

d\) Find $P(X=1.0)$

***Solution:***

\(a\)

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=2,fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(1.8, 2, 1, 1))

curve(0.5*x,ylab = "f(x)",lwd=2,col="red",xlim=c(0,2),main="Graph of  f(x)=0.5x", cex.axis=0.7,cex.lab=1.0,cex.main=0.8)
```

b\) Here, $f(x)\ge 0$ for all values of $x$ in the interval $0\le x\le2$.

Now, **total area under curve** $f(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=2$ is

$\int_{0}^2 f(x)dx$

$=AREA \ \ of\ \  the\ \  SHADED\ \  Triangle$

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=2,fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(1.8, 2, 1, 1))
# Create a plot
plot(1, type = "n", xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)",main="", 
     xlim = c(0, 2), ylim = c(0, 1), 
     cex.axis=1.0,cex.lab=1.0,cex.main=1)

# Define the vertices of the triangle
x <- c(0, 2, 2)
y <- c(0, 0, 1)

# Draw the triangle
polygon(x, y,  border = "blue")
polygon(x,y,col="lightblue")
text(1.5, 0.3, labels = "P(0<X<2)=1", pos = 3, col = "black")

```

$$
=\frac{1}{2} \times base\times height
$$

$$
=\frac{1}{2} \times 2\times 1=1
$$

So, total area under curve $f(x)$ is $1$ that is $\int_{0}^{2} f(x)dx=1$.

Hence, $f(x)$ is a PDF.

c\) Here,

$$
P(X<1)=Area \ \ under\ \ the \ \ curve \ \ from \ \ x=0 \ \ to  \ \ x=1
$$

$$
=Area \ \ of \ \ the \ \ SHADED \ \ Triangle
$$

```{r fig.width=4, fig.height=2,fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(1.8, 2, 1, 1))
# Create a plot
plot(1, type = "n", xlab = "x", ylab = "f(x)",main="", 
     xlim = c(0, 2), ylim = c(0, 1), 
     cex.axis=0.8,cex.lab=0.8,cex.main=0.9)

# Define the vertices of the triangle
x <- c(0, 2, 2)
y <- c(0, 0, 1)

# Draw the triangle
polygon(x, y,  border = "blue")
polygon(c(0,1,1),c(0,0,.5),col="lightblue")
# Add labels to the vertices
text(0.73, 0.1, labels = "P(X<1)=0.25", pos = 3, col = "black",cex=.8)



```

$$
=\frac{1}{2}\times 1 \times f(1)=\frac{1}{2}\times 1 \times 0.5=0.25
$$

Therefore $P(X<1)=0.25$

d\) $P(X=1.0)=0$ \[Because there is no area at $x=1.0$\]

::: callout-note
We always remember that **Probability in an interval of** $X$ is a**ctually the** $AREA$ **under the pdf** $f(x)$**.**

**Problem 6.2.1** A random variable has the following density function.

$$
f(x)=1-0.5x \ \ ; \ \ 0<x<2
$$\
a) Graph the density function.

b\) Verify that $f(x)$ is a density function.

c\) Fond $P(X>1)$.

d\) Find $P(X<0.5)$.

e\) Find $P(X=1.5)$.

**Problem 6.2.2** The following function is the density function for the random variable X :

$$
f(x)=\frac{x-1}{8} \ \ ; 1<x<5
$$

a\) Graph the density function.

b\) Find the probability that X lies between 2 and 4.

c\) What is the probability that X is less than 3?

## **Expectation and variance of continuous r.v**

If $X$ is a continuous r.v with PDF $f(x)$ then

Expected value of $X$ is

$$
\mu=E(X)= \int_{x\in \mathbb{R}} x\cdot f(x)dx
$$ Variance of $X$ is

$$
Var(X)=E(X^2)-\mu^2=\int_{x\in \mathbb{R}} x^2\cdot f(x)dx-\mu^2
$$

## Uniform probability distribution/r.v

A continuous r.v $X$ is said to be uniform r.v ranges between $a$ to $b$ if it has the following PDF

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{b-a} \ \ ; \ \ a<x<b
$$ {#eq-unif.pdf}

![Graph of f(x)](images/clipboard-872051030.png){#fig-Uniform fig-align="left" width="329"}

with

**Mean:** $\mu=E(X)=\frac{a+b}{2}$

**Variance:** $\sigma^2=\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$

[**We write,**]{.underline} $X\sim U(a,b)$

### Finding probability for uniform r.v [@keller2014]

If $X\sim U(a,b)$ then the $P(x_1<X<x_2)$ is actually the **area of the shaded rectangle.**

![Computing area for an interval of Uniform distribution](images/clipboard-2697347670.png){#fig-areaunif fig-align="left" width="298"}

That is,

$$
P(x_1<X<x_2)=Base\times Heght=(x_2-x_1)\times \frac{1}{b-a}
$$

## Normal distribution/r.v

The normal distribution is arguably the most popular and commonly used distribution. It is compatible with a wide range of human attributes, including height, weight, length, speed, IQ, academic success, and years of life expectancy.\
\
A large number of business and industrial variables are also normally distributed. Several variables, such as the annual cost of household insurance, the cost per square foot of warehouse space rental, and managers' happiness with ownership support on a five-point scale, could result in data that are normally distributed. Also, most things that are manufactured or filled by machines are normally distributed.

Due to its numerous uses, the normal distribution is a very significant distribution. In addition to the several variables that are normally distributed that have been described, **statistical inference**, **statistical process control** rely heavily on the normal distribution. No matter the form of the underlying distribution from which they are derived, many statistics are normally distributed when sufficiently large sample sizes are obtained [@black2012].

### Definition

A continuous r.v $X$ is said to be normal r.v if it has the following **PDF:**

$$
f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-\frac{1}{2} (\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2}\ \ ; -\infty<x<\infty
$$ {#eq-normal}

The graph of $f(x)$ is called **normal curve** (@fig-normalpdf)**.**

```{r fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
#| label: fig-normalpdf
#| fig-cap: "Normal Curve"
#| fig-align: left

library(tidyverse)

# Create a sequence of x values
x <- seq(10, 30, length = 100)

# Calculate the y values for the normal distribution
y <- dnorm(x,20,3)

# Create a data frame
data <- data.frame(x, y)


ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue",lwd=1) +
  labs(title = " ", 
  x=expression(mu), y = "f(x)")+
  geom_vline(xintercept=20)+
  theme_classic()+
  theme(axis.text=element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
        )->normal.curve
normal.curve  
```

**Mean:** $E(X)=\mu$

**Variance:** $Var(X)=\sigma^2$

[**We write:**]{.underline} $X\sim N(\mu , \sigma^2)$

**Properties of normal distribution**

-   The **total area** under the normal curve $f(x)$ is 1 that is

    $$
    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x)dx=1
    $$

-   Normal distribution is symmetric about mean, $\mu$

-   Mean, median and mode is identical in normal distribution that is $Mean=Median=Mode=\mu$

-   Almost $99\%$ observations of $X$ lie within **3 standard deviation of mean** that is

    $$
    P(\mu-3\sigma<X<\mu+3\sigma)\approx 0.99
    $$

-   Almost $95\%$ observations of $X$ lie within **2 standard deviation of mean** that is $$
    P(\mu-2\sigma<X<\mu+2\sigma)\approx 0.95
    $$

-   Almost $68\%$ observations of $X$ lie within **1 standard deviation of mean** that is $$
    P(\mu-\sigma<X<\mu+\sigma)\approx 0.68
    $$

### Standard normal r.v

Suppose $X\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. Then the variable $Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$ is said to be **standard normal variable** with **PDF**

$$
f(z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt {2\pi}} e^ \frac{-z^2}{2} \ \ ; -\infty<z<\infty
$$ {#eq-standardnorm}

**Mean:** $E(Z)=0$

**Variance:** $Var(Z)=1$

[**We write:**]{.underline} $Z\sim N(0,1)$

```{r fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
#| label: fig-zcurve
#| fig-align: left
#| fig-cap: "Standard normal curve"

par(mar = c(3.77, 3.77, 1, 1))

fz=function(x) {(1/sqrt(2*pi))*exp(-x^2)}

curve(fz,from = -3.2, to = 3.2,
      xlab = "z",ylab = "f(z)",lwd=2)

abline(v = 0, col = "red", lwd = 2)



```

### Computing probability(area) under standard normal curve

To compute area (probability) under the standard normal curve for a given interval of $z$ we use **standard Normal Distribution** **table** which provides cumulative probabilities.

**RULE-I:** Suppose we want to find $P(Z<1.25)$.

From TABLE 1 (Appendix B) in @anderson2020 we have

$$
P(Z<1.25)=0.8944
$$

\
![](images/clipboard-2652389850.png){width="552"}

The probability $P(Z<1.25)$ is shown in @fig-areaz.

```{r fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
#| label: fig-areaz
#| fig-cap: "Area under standard normal curve for Z<1.25"
#| fig-align: left

# Load ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)

# Define the mean and standard deviation
mean <- 0
sd <- 1

# Define the shading bounds for the central 95% interval
lower <- -1.96  # Lower bound (e.g., -1.96 for 95% CI)
upper <- 1.96   # Upper bound (e.g., 1.96 for 95% CI)

# Create a data frame to specify the x range
x_range <- data.frame(x = c(-4, 4))

# Create the plot
ggplot(x_range, aes(x)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-4,4,1)) +
  # Plot the normal distribution curve
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd)) +
  
  # Shade the area under the curve between the lower and upper bounds
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd), geom = "area", 
                xlim = c(-4, 1.25), fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  
  # Labels and theme
  labs(x = "z", y = "f(z)", title = "") +
  theme_classic()+
  annotate("text",x=0,y=0.15,label="P(Z<1.25)=0.8944")

```

**RULE-II:** Now we find $P(Z>1.36)$

So, due to symmetry we can write $P(Z>1.36)=P(Z<-1.36)=0.0869$\

```{r fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
#| label: fig-areaz2
#| fig-cap: "Area under standard normal curve for Z>1.36"
#| fig-align: left

# Create the plot
ggplot(x_range, aes(x)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-4,4,1)) +
  # Plot the normal distribution curve
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  
  # Shade the area under the curve between the lower and upper bounds
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd), geom = "area", xlim = c(1.36, 4), fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  
  # Labels and theme
  labs(x = "z", y = "f(z)", title = "") +
  theme_classic()+
  annotate("text",x=3,y=0.1,label="P(Z>1.36)=0.0869")
```

**RULE-III:** Let us evaluate $P(-1.96<Z<2.58)$.

We can write

$$
=P(-1.96<Z<2.58)
$$

$$
=P(Z<2.58)-P(Z<-1.96)
$$

$$
=0.9951-0.0250=0.9701
$$

```{r fig.height=2.5, fig.width=5}
#| label: fig-areaz3
#| fig-cap: "Area under standard normal curve for -1.96<Z<2.58"
#| fig-align: left

# Create the plot
ggplot(x_range, aes(x)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(-4,4,1)) +
  # Plot the normal distribution curve
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1)) +
  
  # Shade the area under the curve between the lower and upper bounds
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean, sd = sd), geom = "area", xlim = c(-1.96, 2.58), fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.5) +
  
  # Labels and theme
  labs(x = "z", y = "f(z)", title = "") +
  theme_classic()+
  annotate("text",x=-.02,y=.1,label="P(-1.96<Z<2.58)=0.9701")
```

### Finding quantiles (percentiles, quartiles, deciles etc) of $Z$

What is the $90^{th}$ percentile of $Z$? To answer this question, let $k$ is the $90^{th}$ percentile of $Z$. So we can write

$$
P(Z<k)=0.90 \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \cdot \cdot \cdot (1)
$$

From TABLE 1 (Appendix-B) [@anderson2020] we have

$$
P(Z<1.28)=0.90 \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \cdot \cdot \cdot(2)
$$

Comparing eq.(1) with eq.(2) we have $k=1.28$. So the $90^{th}$ percentile of $Z$ is $1.28$.

**Problem 1** Find $c$ such that $P(Z>c)=0.05$.

**Problem 2** Find $c$ such that $P(-c<Z<c)=0.95$.

### Computing probability(area) under normal curve:

Suppose $X\sim N(30, 5^2)$ . Then find the following:

a\) $P(X<22)$

b\) $P(X>44)$

c\) $P(20<X<35)$

d\) If $P(X<x)=0.25$ then find the value of $x$.

***Solution:***

Here, $\mu=30$ and $\sigma=5$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

a\) $P(X<22)=P(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}<\frac{22-30}{5})=P(Z<-1.60)=0.0548$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

b\) $P(X>44)=P(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}>\frac{44-30}{5})$

$=P(Z>2.80)=P(Z<-2.80)=0.0026$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

c\) $P(20<X<35)=P(\frac{20-30}{5}<\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}<\frac{35-30}{5})$

$=P(-2<Z<1)=P(Z<1)-P(Z<-2)$

$=0.8413-0.0228=0.8185$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

d\) To find the value of $x$ we proceed this way.

$$
P(X<x)=0.25
$$ $$
\implies P(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}<\frac{x-30}{5})=0.25
$$

$$
\implies P(Z<\frac{x-30}{5})=0.25 \ \ \ \ \ \cdot \cdot \cdot (1)
$$

From TABLE (Appendix B) we have

$$
P(Z<-0.67)=0.25  \ \ \ \ \cdot \cdot \cdot (2)
$$

Comparing (1) with (2) we can write

$$
\frac{x-30}{5}=-0.67
$$ $$
\implies x=30+(-0.67)\times 5
$$

$$
\therefore x=26.65
$$

::: callout-note
If $P(X<x)=p$ and

$P(Z<z)=p$ then

$$
x=\mu+z\sigma
$$
