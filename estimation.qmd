# Introduction to estimation

In previous chapter we discuss the sampling properties of the sample mean and varance. In this chapter we discuss abot the **parameter estimation**.It falls under the bracnh of **Statistical Inference.** The process of estimation involves determining the approximate value of a population parameter on the basis of sample data. There are two types **parameter estimation-(i) point estimation** and **(ii) interval estimation.**

## Point Estimation

-   To estimate the value of a **population parameter,** we compute a corresponding characteristic of the sample, referred to as a **sample statistic**.

-   By making the preceding computations, we perform the statistical procedure called **point estimation**. For instance, we refer to the sample mean $\bar x$ as the **point estimator** of the population mean $\mu$.

-   The numerical value obtained for , is called the **point estimate**.

: Some common population parameters and their estimators {#tbl-tab9.1}

### Properties of Point Estimators

Suppose

$\theta$ be the population parameter of interest

$\hat \theta$ be the sample statistic or point estimator of $\theta$

A "good" estimator has some desirable properties.

::: callout-note
## Unbiased

A sample statistic $\hat \theta$ is said to be unbiased estimator of the population parameter $\theta$ if

$$
E(\hat\theta)=\theta
$$
:::

**Problem 9.1** Show that the function of sample mean $\bar X$ is the unbiased estimator of population mean $\mu$.

[Solution:]{.underline}

Here $X$ is the variable of interest and let $X_1,X_2,...,X_n$ is a sequence of random sample provided $E(X_i)=\mu$. The sample mean is $\bar X=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n X_i}{n}$.

Now

$$
E(\bar X)=E\left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i }{n}\right)=\frac{1}{n}E\left( \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right)
$$

$$
=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \mu=\frac{1}{n}\cdot n\mu=\mu
$$

$$
\therefore E(\bar X)=\mu
$$

So, $\bar X$ is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$.

**Problem 9.2** Show that the function of sample variance $S^2=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i-\bar X)^2}{n-1}$ is an unbiased estimator of population variance $\sigma^2$.

[Solution:]{.underline} See @newbold2013, page 283, or we can proof it as follows:

Suppose that $X$ is a random variable with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Let $X_1, X_2 â€¦ X_n$ be a random sample of size $n$ from the population represented by $X$.

We know $E(\bar X)=\mu_{\bar X}=\mu$ .

So,

$Var(X)$ , $\sigma^2=E(X^2)-\mu^2$

Or, $E(X^2)=\mu^2+\sigma^2$

and

$Var(\bar X)$, $\sigma^2_{\bar X}=E(\bar X^2)-\mu_{\bar X}^2$

Or, $E(\bar X^2)=\mu_{\bar X}^2+\sigma^2_{\bar X}=\mu^2+\frac{\sigma^2}{n}$

Now,

$E(S^2)=E\left[ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\bar X)^2}{n-1}\right]=\frac{1}{n-1}E \sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\bar X)^2=\frac{1}{n-1}E\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i^2+\bar X^2-2 X_i \bar X)$

$=\frac{1}{n-1} E\left ( \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2-n\bar X^2 \right)=\frac{1}{n-1} \left [\sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i^2)-n E(\bar X^2) \right]$\

$=\frac{1}{n-1} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^n (\mu^2+\sigma^2)-n(\mu^2+\frac{\sigma^2}{n}) \right]=\frac{1}{n-1} \left[ n\mu^2+n \sigma^2-n\mu^2-\sigma^2 \right]$

$=\frac{1}{n-1}(n-1) \sigma^2=\sigma^2$

$\therefore E(S^2)=\sigma^2$.

Hence $S^2$ is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$.

: Annual Salary and Training Program Status for a Simple Random Sample of 30 EAI Managers {#tbl-tab9.2}

a\) **Compute** *sample mean* and *standard deviation* of annual salary (\$) of a random sample of 30 EAI managers.

[Solution:]{.underline}

Let $\mu$ be the population mean of annual salary of all EAI managers.

If $X$ is the annual salary in '000 USD, then the to estimate $\mu$ we use **sample mean** $\bar x$ as follows:

$$
\bar x=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}{n}=\frac{49.09+53.26+...+57.31}{30}\approx51.1457 
$$

So the **sample mean** is $\$ 51145.7$.

Similarly let $\sigma$ be the population standard deviation of annual salary of all EAI managers.

The estimate of $\sigma$ is the **sample standard deviation** $s$ as follows:

$$
s=\sqrt \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 -n\cdot (\bar x)^2}{n-1}
$$

$$
=\sqrt \frac{(49.09^2+53.26^2+...+57.31^2)-30\cdot (51.1457)^2}{30-1}
$$

$$
\approx 3.5408
$$

So the **sample standard deviation** is $\$ 3540.8$.

b\) Also, **estimate** the *proportion* of managers in the population who completed the management training program.

[Solution:]{.underline} Here, $n=30$

Let, $p$ be the population proportion of managers who completed the training

The estimate of $p$ is:

$$
\hat p=\frac {\# \ \ of\ \ yes}{n}=\frac{20}{30}=0.6667\approx 66.67\%
$$

**Problem 9.4** [@anderson2020]Many drugs used to treat cancer are expensive. Business Week reported on the cost per treatment of Herceptin, a drug used to treat breast cancer (Business Week, January 30, 2006). Typical treatment costs (in dollars) for Herceptin are provided by a simple random sample of 10 patients.

4376 ,5578, 2717, 4920, 4495, 4798, 6446, 4119, 4237, 3814

a\) **Develop** a point estimate of the mean cost per treatment with Herceptin.

b\) **Develop** a point estimate of the standard deviation of the cost per treatment with Herceptin.

## Interval estimation

Instead of estimating a population parameter by a single value (point estimator) it is more reasonable to estimate with an **interval** with some confidence (probability) that our **parameter** value will be in the **interval.**

::: callout-note
## Interval Estimator

An **interval estimator** is a rule for determining (based on sample information) an interval that is likely to include the parameter. The general form of an interval estimate is as follows:

$$
Point\ \ estimate \pm margin \ \ of \ \ error
$$
:::

Due to sampling variability, **interval estimator** is also random.

### Interval estimate of a population mean: $\sigma$ known

The $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ is :

$$
\bar x \pm z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}
$$ {#eq-9.1}

Or,

$$
\bar x-z_{\alpha/2}\frac {\sigma}{\sqrt n}, \bar x+z_{\alpha/2}\frac {\sigma}{\sqrt n}
$$

We can express this confidence interval in a probabilistic way:

$$
P\left( \bar x-z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}<\mu<\bar x+z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}  \right)=1-\alpha
$$

**NOTE:**

1\) Here, $z_{\alpha/2}$ is the $z$ value providing an area of $\alpha/2$ in the upper tail of the standard normal distribution that is $P(Z>z_{\alpha/2})=\alpha/2$.

2\) $z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}$ is often called **margin of error (ME)**.

### **Interpretation of confidence interval**

The probabilistic equation of confidence interval says that, if we repeatedly construct confidence intervals in this manner, we will expect $(1-\alpha)100\%$ of them contain $\mu$.

### Understanding confidence interval through Simulation

Suppose $X\sim N(50,5^2)$ . Now consider a population data of size $N=10000$ and the histogram of $X$ is:

```{r}
set.seed(36)
X<-rnorm(10000,50,5)

hist(X,freq = F,sub= "Population size, N=10000")
lines(density(X),lwd=2)
```

Now we draw a random sample of size $n=50$ from this population and construct a 95% confidence interval (CI) for $\mu$. The CI may or may not include the $\mu=50$ !!!

```{r}
set.seed(36)
mu=50;sigma=5

## Constructing (1-alpha)*100% CI

alpha=0.05 

con.coef=1-alpha # confidence level

z=round(abs(qnorm(alpha/2)),2)# z=1.96

n=50 # sample size

s.e<-sigma/sqrt(n)

sampl_1<-sample(X,n)
cat("Sample data :", sampl_1)

cat("Sample mean:",round(mean(sampl_1),2))

ci_1<-c(lower=mean(sampl_1)-z*s.e,upper=mean(sampl_1)+z*s.e)
#ci_1[1]
cat("95%  CI:","\n", "[Lower ,Upper]","\n", "[",round(ci_1[1],2),",",round(ci_1[2],2),"]")
```

Luckily our 95% CI contains the true population mean $\mu=50$ ðŸ˜Š.

Lets simulate 100 samples each of size $n=50$ and construct all 95% CIs.

```{r}
#| label: fig-conf_sim
#| fig-cap: "Simulation of 95% confidence intervals for $\\mu$"

library(tidyverse)

# Suppose, X~N(50,5^2); so
#cat("mu=",50,",", "sigma=",5)



# Let simulate 100 samples each of size n=50

sampl=0

B=100 # number of samples we have drawn from population X

sampl<-(replicate(B,sample(X,n,replace = FALSE)))

sample.means<-colMeans(sampl)

#class(sample.means)

sample.means<-as.data.frame(sample.means)
#class(sample.means)

sample.means%>%rename(x_bar=sample.means)->sample.means

ci<-sample.means%>%mutate(ll=x_bar-z*s.e,ul=x_bar+z*s.e)

ci%>%mutate(id=1:100)%>%select(id,x_bar,ll,ul)->ci

ci%>%mutate(Capture=ifelse(50>ll & 50<ul,"1","0"))->ci_95

#ci%>%head()

# https://statisticsglobe.com/draw-plot-with-confidence-intervals-in-r

colorset = c('0'='red','1'='black')


labels<- expression("Population mean,"~mu == 50)

ggplot(ci_95, aes(id, x_bar)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ll, ymax = ul,color = Capture))+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 50, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue")+
  scale_color_manual(values = colorset)+
  ylim(45,55)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1,100,5),limits=c(0, 101))+
  #annotate("text",label=paste("Population mean,mu=",mu),x=90,y=54)+
  annotate("text",x=90,y=53.5,label=as.character(labels),parse=TRUE)+
    labs(title =paste(con.coef*100, "% Confidence Intervals, n =", n),
       x="Sample ID")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_bw()
```

We can see that out of 100 CIs , 95 of them contain true population mean $\mu=50$ and the rest 5 do not.

: Four Commonly Used Confidence Levels and $z_{\alpha/2}$ {#tbl-tab9.3}

### Interval estimate of a population mean: $\sigma$ unknown

The $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for $\mu$ is :

$$
\bar x \pm t_{\alpha/2} \frac{s}{\sqrt n}
$$ {#eq-9.2}

Or,

$$
\bar x-t_{\alpha/2}\frac {s}{\sqrt n}, \bar x+t_{\alpha/2}\frac {s}{\sqrt n}
$$

We can express this confidence interval in a probabilistic way:

$$
P\left( \bar x-t_{\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt n}<\mu<\bar x+t_{\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt n}  \right)=1-\alpha
$$

Here, $t_{\alpha/2}$ is the $t$ value providing an area of $\alpha/2$ in the upper tail of the $t$ distribution with $(n-1)$ degrees of freedom that is $P(T>t_{\alpha/2,n-1})=\alpha/2$.

**Problem 9.5** [@keller2014, page 341] In a survey conducted to determine, among other things, the cost of vacations, 64 individuals were randomly sampled.

Assuming that the standard deviation is \$400, **estimate** with 95% confidence the average cost of all vacations.\

**Problem 9.6** [@keller2014, page 340] It is known that the amount of time needed to change the oil on a car is normally distributed with a standard deviation of 5 minutes. The amount of time to complete a random sample of 10 oil changes was recorded and listed here. **Compute** the 99% confidence interval estimate of the mean of the population.

From a random sample of 400 students the mean cost was found to be \$357.75, and the sample standard deviation was \$37.89. Assuming that the population is normally distributed, find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean.\

**Problem 9.8** [@newbold2013, page 302]Twenty people in one large metropolitan area were asked to record the time (in minutes) that it takes them to drive to work. These times were as follows:

30, 42, 35, 40, 45, 22, 32, 15, 41, 45, 28, 32, 45, 27, 47, 50, 30, 25, 46, 25

Assuming that the population is normally distributed find the 99% confidence interval for the population mean of time it takes to drive to work.

### Interval estimation for population proportion : Large sample

From previous chapter we know if $np$ and $np(1-p)$ is equal or greater than $5$ then the sample proportion $\hat p$ will approximately follow **normal distribution** with **mean** $p$ and **variance** $\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$.

Mathematically,

$$
Z=\frac{\hat p-p}{\sqrt {\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}\approx follows \ \ N(0,1)
$$

Since $p$ is unknown we estimate $var(\hat p)$ as $\sqrt { \frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}$.

**Confidence Interval for Population Proportion,** $p$ **(Large Samples)**

$$
\hat p\pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt {\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}
$$ {#eq-9.3}\
which is valid provided that $n\hat p$ and $n(1 - \hat p)$ are greater than 5.
