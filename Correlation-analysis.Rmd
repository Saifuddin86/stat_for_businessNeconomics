# Correlation

Correlation implies **degree** and **direction** of *linear relationship* between two *quantitative variables*. Example:

-   As *income* increases *expense* also increases (positive correlation);

-   As *resistance* increases *current flow* decreases (negative correlation) etc.

# Scatter plot: Graphical method to explore correlation

A scatter plot shows the relationship between two quantitative variables measured for the same individuals. The values of one variable appear on the horizontal axis, and the values of the other variable appear on the vertical axis. Each individual in the data appears as a point on the graph.

-   A scatterplot *displays* the strength, direction, and form of the relationship between two quantitative variables (*see* Figure \@ref(fig:scatter-plot)).

# Pearson correlation coefficient

The correlation coefficient *measures* the strength of the relationship between two quantitative variables.

**Pearson correlation coefficient** or **sample correlation coefficient** is denoted by \textit {\textbf {r}} and computed as follows:

\begin{equation}
r=\frac{s_{xy}}{s_x s_y} \tag{1}
\end{equation}

**Note that**, $r$ is a number between -1 to +1 that is $-1\le r \le +1$.

Here, $$
s_{xy}=\frac{\sum (x-\bar x)(y-\bar y)}{n-1}=\frac{\sum xy-n\bar x \bar y}{n-1} \ \ (Sample \ \ covariance \ \ of\ \ X, Y)
$$

$$s_x=\sqrt {\frac{\sum (x-\bar x)^2}{n-1}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum x^2-n\bar x^2}{n-1}} \ \ (Sample \ \ standard\ \ deviation \ \ of\ \ X)
$$

$$s_y=\sqrt {\frac{\sum (y-\bar y)^2}{n-1}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum y^2-n\bar y^2}{n-1}}\ \ (Sample \ \ standard\ \ deviation \ \ of\ \ Y)
$$

## An example: Computation and interpretation of $r$

Six observations taken for two variables follow.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(broom)
library(data.table)

x=c(30,50,40,55,30,25)
y=c(28,25,25,23,30,32)
Example1<-data.frame(x,y)
#row.names(Example1)<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6)

Example1 %>% t() %>% kable(align = "c")

#plot(x,y)
```

a.  Develop a scatter diagram for these data.
b.  What does the scatter diagram indicate about a relationship between x and y?
c.  Compute and interpret the sample covariance.
d.  Compute and interpret the sample correlation coefficient

**Solution**

> **a.** Scatter diagram between $X$ and $Y$

```{r scatter-XY, fig.cap="Scatter diagram between X and Y"}
plot(x,y,pch=19,main = "")
abline(lm(y~x))

#sum(x*y)

```

> **b.** The Figure \@ref(fig:scatter-XY) indicates *negative correlation* between *X* and *Y*.

> **c.** We know the sample covariance is:

$$
s_{xy}=\frac{\sum xy-n\bar x \bar y}{n-1} 
$$

Here,

-   Total number of observations is: $n=6$

-   $\sum xy=x_1y_1+x_2y_2+...+x_ny_n=30\times 28+50\times 25+...+25\times 32=6055$ `r #sum(x*y)`

-   $\sum x=230$ `r #sum(x)`; $\sum y=163$ `r #sum(y)`

-   $\sum x^2=9550$ `r #sum(x^2)`

-   $\sum y^2=4487$ `r #sum(y^2)`

-   $\bar x=\frac {\sum x}{n}=\frac{230}{6}=38.33$

-   $\bar y=\frac {\sum y}{n}=\frac{163}{6}=27.17$

So,

$$
s_{xy}=\frac{\sum xy-n\bar x \bar y}{n-1}=\frac{6055-6*38.33*27.17}{6-1}=-38.67
$$

The negative *covariance* indicates $X$ and $Y$ are negatively related.

> **d.** We know, sample correlation coefficient:

$$
r=\frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y}
$$

Now

$$s_x=\sqrt{\frac{\sum x^2-n\bar x^2}{n-1}}=\sqrt \frac{9550-6*38.33^2}{6-1}=12.12
$$ and

$$s_y=\sqrt{\frac{\sum y^2-n\bar y^2}{n-1}}=\sqrt \frac{4487-6*27.17^2}{6-1}=3.40
$$ Hence,

$$
r=\frac{s_{xy}}{s_xs_y}=\frac{-38.67}{12.12\times 3.40}=-0.9384
$$

**Interpretation of** $r$: Since, $r=-0.9384$ so $X$ and $Y$ are strongly negatively correlated. That is, if $X$ increases then $Y$ also decreases and vice-versa.

## Another example:

The following data shows the *Miles/gallon (mpg)* and *Horse power (hp)* of 10 automobiles.

| **hp**  | 110 | 110 | 93.0 | 110.0 | 175.0 | 105.0 | 245.0 | 62.0 | 95.0 | 123.0 |
|:-------:|:---:|:---:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|
| **mpg** | 21  | 21  | 22.8 | 21.4  | 18.7  | 18.1  | 14.3  | 24.4 | 22.8 | 19.2  |

(a) **Construct** a *scatter plot*.
(b) **Compute** *correlation coefficient* between *mpg* and *wt*. Explain your finding.

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
DATA<-mtcars[1:10,c("mpg","hp")]
DATA %>% select(hp,mpg)->DATA


```

**Solution (a)**

Figure \@ref(fig:scatter-mpg) shows positive correlation between *horse power* and *mpg*.

```{r scatter-mpg, fig.cap="Scatter plot between HP and MPG" }
plot(DATA$hp,DATA$mpg,pch=19,col="darkblue",lwd=1,
     xlab = "Horsepower(hp)",ylab = "	Miles/gallon",
     main = "")
abline(lm(DATA$mpg~DATA$hp))
```

**Solution (b)**

```{r}
r=round(cor(x,y),4)
```

-   The correlation coefficient between *horse power* and *mpg* is -0.9308.

-   It indicates that *mpg* is strongly and negatively correlated with *horse power*.

## Correlation vs. causation

*Correlation* does not always imply *causation*. For example,

-   A study[@messerli2012] found that there was a significant ($r=0.791$) positive correlation between *chocolate consumption per capita* and *number of Nobel laureates per 10 million persons*. This does not necessarily implies that more a country consumes chocolate, more the chance of getting a Nobel prize. Rather differences in socioeconomic status from country to country and geographic and climatic factors may play some role to win a Nobel prize.

-   We might find that there is a positive correlation between the time spent driving on road and the number of accidents but this does not mean that spending more time on road causes accident.Because in that case, in order to avoid accidents one may drive fast so that time spent on road is less [@selvamuthu2024].
